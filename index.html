	                        <p>Well, hello there! I'm excited you came to my portfolio to learn more about me and my time as a web developer. So since you're here, let me give you the grand tour. My name is Matthew, and I'm currently looking into being a junior developer for a career change. Prior to this, I was an English teacher and my incorporation of technology into my teaching led me to seek further immersion into the technology my students and colleagues used on a daily basis. Through my time as an educator, I was able to hone my communication skills and collaborative mindset to let me work in any team environment. Lay down an objective and rest assured, I'll get right into how I can best help the team reach that objective. I'll always keep my teammates in the loop of what's going on from my end, boiling it down to the most essential parts, as my educational training has instilled in me. I find that being able to work with others and help us learn from each other to be a great experience for all those involved.</p>
	                        <p>But that's all the professional side of me, and you want to know what I'm like outside of the job. I'm one of the biggest nerds you'll ever meet, and I have to convention badges to prove it. Star Wars, Marvel Comics, Steven Universe, Harry Potter, pretty much anything that is considered "nerdy", either I grew up with it or have some passing familiarity with. I love learning about all of these things, and it helps fuel my imagination for what is possible. I'm also prepared to handle lots of different situations; it pays to be prepared. You'll find me with a bag full of useful items that get me through the day efficiently and without hassle. People have called my bag the TARDIS of carry-alls. They're not wrong.</p>
	                        <p>If this has interested you, and you want to know more, please contact me through any of my channels.</p>
